# Driving-Theory-Game
My Computer Science A-Level project which was made on Unity. It is a simple driving game with a simple interface, linked to a local database. It was written in C++ and SQL.
Once the app is ran, a simple login menu appears. It is linked to a local database so data can be saved upon closing.
The main menu then appears displaying: play game, previous mistakes, road signs, settings and logout.
Settings menu currently just displays the controls.
Road signs can display the road signs used in the game.
Previous mistakes is connected to the database and displays the most recent 5 incorrect answers made from the game.
The game itself is a top down driving game where you have to chase the moving cars to accept and answer quests. If the player collides with the environemnt it takes damage. Thr player also takes damage for every incorrect answer and for every correct answer it gains points. Upon death it displays the longest time played and highest points gained.
To move the car it is WASD and to interact with the NPC's it is E.
